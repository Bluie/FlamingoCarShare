Flamingo Car Share is a web/mobile application for running a car share service.
The aim of this project is to provide a functioning application that incorporates
the ability to rent these cars through a booking system through the use of the web
and mobile application. Furthermore, the customers will have the ability to register,
book a vehicle of their choice for a time and place, and return the vehicle when finished.
